            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p><strong>Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, affects approximately 5.8 million people of all ages in the United States which is approximately 1.7% of the current population. This disease is characteristic of impairment in memory and eventual impairments in reasoning, planning, language, and perception. Recent studies have shown that phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) is an important pathway for neurogenesis, long term potentiation (LTP), and the development of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [1,15]. These two pathways, CREB and BDNF, are both extremely important in mediating the formation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) which is thought to be the main player in the case of Alzheimer’s disease as these plaques aggregate and suppress these pathways [1,3,14]. BDNF has been implicated to have neurotrophic effects when bound to a protein fragment known as the alpha secretase amyloid precursor protein complex (αSAPPC) through a process known as ectodomain shedding [10]. The ectodomain shedding is a result of alpha secretase (α-secretase) cutting an amyloid precursor protein (APP) to create the αSAPP complex. This process in conjunction with BDNF releases the neurotrophic protein fragment into the extracellular environment which promotes synapse formation and counteracts apoptotic signaling [2,13]. This pathway has not been fully explored; however, it has shown promise with the potential for upregulation and subsequent neurotrophic effects [8]. Researchers have made blockers for the beta-secretase (β-secretase) pathway, yet liver dysfunction occurred in some cases when the blocker went to human trials and it was subsequently discontinued even though it did not show the same effects in trials with mice [5,12,14]. γ-Secretase, the third and final protease that is involved in the Aβ pathway is important in many important bodily functions such as immune function, cell development, and homeostasis [7]. Currently there are four known precursor subunits of the gamma-secretase complex: nicastrin, presenilin-1, PEN-2, APH-1, and an anti-catalytic protein known as CD147 [9,17,18]. The gamma-secretase (γ-secretase) pathway for amyloid precursor protein (APP) has not been fully explored as a pathway to cure/treat Alzheimer’s disease. 
</strong></p><p><strong>The goal of this study is to identify whether the knockout of one of the four subunits of the γ-secretase will affect the formation of Aβ aggregate plaques. This information could be used for a possible therapeutic in the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer’s disease where the β-secretase inhibitors fell short. Given that the γ-secretase pathway is not fully explored, we hypothesize that a knockout through a Cre-Lox recombination system of the targeted precursor subunit named presenilin-1 in the γ-secretase pathway will lead to a decreased amount of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in the brain of mice. This study is important due to the current lack of knowledge of the four subunits of γ-secretase and how they affect the pathway if they are knocked out. Current potential treatments are in clinical trials for the β-secretase pathways; however, they are only aimed to prevent Alzheimer’s and prevent new plaques from forming rather than promote a cure for the disease once it has already progressed to its later stages [14].
</strong></p><p><strong>To identify whether a knockout of presenilin-1 will lead to a decreased amount of aggregated amyloid-β peptides, we will employ the following aims:
</strong></p><p><strong>AIM 1: Determine whether a Cre-Lox mediated presenilin-1 knockout decreases aggregated amyloid-β peptides.
</strong></p><p><strong>We will begin by using an F0 generation with a Cre mouse and a LoxP (Floxed) mouse with the presenilin-1 gene targeted. In the F1 generation the CreLoxP mouse will have the mutated presenilin-1 gene and the production of presenilin-1 should halt. The presenilin-1 knockout group will be set against a LoxP mouse that was not in generation with a Cre mouse as the control group. The mice brains will be dissected and the amyloid-β peptide amount will be quantified through the ELISA method [16].
</strong></p><p><strong>AIM 2: Determine whether a shRNA-mediated presenilin-1 knockdown decreases aggregated amyloid-β peptides.
</strong></p><p><strong>We will begin by using a viral vector known as an adeno-associated virus (AAV) introduced into the nuclei of a target embryonic stem cell (ES) where it will propagate throughout development [6]. After expression in the nucleus the shRNAs are processed by Drosha and exported by Exportin-5 to the cytoplasm where they associate with Dicer. After association with RISC and removal of one of the RNA strands, they target mRNAs possessing the complementary sequence [11] being the sequence for presenilin-1. A control group will live in coexistence with the presenilin-1 knockdown mice. The mice brains will be dissected and the amyloid-β peptide amount will be quantified through the ELISA method [16].</strong></p><p><strong>

This disease is characteristic of impairment in memory and eventual impairments in reasoning, planning, language, and perception. There are currently four known precursor subunits for the gamma-secretase complex: nicastrin, presenilin, PEN-2, and APH-1 [9,17,18]. The gamma secretase system is important in immune function, cell development, and homeostasis [7]. Previous approaches to manipulate the system such as blocking the beta secretase pathway through drugs have been discontinued as they showed possible side effects to liver function when the pathway blocker was introduced [5,12,14]. Ectodomain shedding is a result of alpha secretase (α-secretase) cutting an amyloid precursor protein (APP) to create the αSAPP complex. This process in conjunction with BDNF releases a neurotrophic protein fragment into the extracellular environment which promotes synapse formation and counteracts apoptotic signaling [2,13]. This alpha secretase pathway has not been fully explored; however, it has shown promise with the potential for upregulation and subsequent neurotrophic effects if quantities of alpha secretase are increased [8]. BDNF is important in hippocampal neurogenesis and plays a neuroprotective role [10]. CREB is important in neurogenesis, long term potentiation, and the creation of BDNF [1,15]. BDNF and CREB pathways are suppressed when amyloid beta plaques are introduced into the cellular space [1,3,14]. An anti-catalytic protein known as CD147 has shown promise to downregulate gamma secretase protein synthetization [18]. 
</strong></p><p><strong>Presently, how the removal of presenilin in the gamma secretase pathway impacts/affects the amount and formation of amyloid beta plaque in the brain is not known. Previous studies suggest that an upregulation in alpha secretase and a downregulation in beta secretase both respectively decrease the amount of amyloid beta plaques in the brain, therefore, the premise of this proposal is that since the beta secretase pathway acts in a similar manner to gamma secretase the downregulation of gamma secretase will decrease in amyloid beta plaques. The significance of this project lies within developing a new potential treatment for Alzheimer’s disease and the possibility to disrupt the formation of amyloid beta plaques subsequently leading to increased neurogenesis.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p><strong>The conceptual innovation of this proposal lies in determining the effect of removing the presenilin precursor from the gamma secretase pathway and how it subsequently affects the amount of amyloid beta plaques present in the brain measured by the ELISA method [16]. The four currently known precursor subunits for the gamma-secretase complex are: nicastrin, presenilin, PEN-2, and APH-1 [9,17,18]. The gamma secretase system is important in immune function, cell development, and homeostasis [7]. The alpha secretase system has been upregulated and the beta secretase system has been downregulated; both the upregulation and downregulation respectively decreased the amount and aggregation of amyloid beta plaques around synapses [2,5,12,13,14]. Since beta secretase performs a relatively similar function to gamma secretase in theory; if downregulated it should decrease the amount of amyloid beta plaque formation and aggregation. If this approach proves to be successful, in that the amount of amyloid beta plaques around neurons decreases; it could prove useful as a treatment to Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia.
</strong></p><p><strong>In addition, the proposed experiments utilize a technically innovative approach to target a precursor in the pathway to affect the system as little as possible while still eliminating new formation of amyloid beta plaques rather than a wholistic approach to the other pathways. Previous approaches to manipulate the system such as the beta secretase blocker pathway have been discontinued as they showed possible side effects to liver function; however, the effects to liver function were not seen in animal trials on mice [5,12,14]. Another manipulation that has been attempted, but not fully explored was the upregulation of alpha secretase. This would in theory increase the amount of ectodomain shedding from the amyloid precursor protein and in turn less amyloid beta plaques would aggregate [2,10,13]. Upregulation of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has also been used to manipulate the amount of amyloid beta plaques that are formed [10]. BDNF plays a very important neurotrophic role in conjunction with the alpha secretase amyloid precursor protein complex to increase synaptic wellbeing and promote synaptic growth [1,15]. Investigating the role of presenilin in the gamma secretase pathway could prove useful in treating/preventing Alzheimer’s disease, and more specifically the formation of amyloid beta plaques. Collectively, the proposed experiments will advance our understanding of the mechanism in the formation of amyloid beta plaques through the gamma secretase pathway by taking a single precursor out of the system and subsequently provide the possibility of a therapy for treating Alzheimer’s disease.</strong></p><p><strong>

</strong></p><p><strong>Hypothesis: Knocking out the presenilin-1 precursor through a Cre-Lox system will stop the gamma secretase protein from forming and will subsequently decrease aggregate amyloid-beta peptides around neurons.
</strong></p><p><strong>Background: The three main proteases involved in cutting the amyloid precursor protein (APP) are gamma secretase, beta secretase, and alpha secretase. The alpha secretase protein, when bound with the amyloid precursor protein, creates the alpha secretase amyloid precursor protein (αSAPP) complex. When the αSAPP complex binds with brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) it releases a neurotrophic fragment into the extracellular environment that promotes healthy synapse formation and counteracts apoptotic signaling leading to longer cell life [3,9,15]. The beta secretase and gamma secretase proteins work in conjunction together to cut the APP to a shortened fragment which is commonly known as the amyloid beta plaque. These plaques aggregate around synapses and dysregulate the production of BDNF and phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) which are both involved in hippocampal neurogenesis [2,17]. The four current known precursors of the targeted pathway in this study, the gamma secretase pathway, are nicastrin, prenenilin-1, PEN-2, and APH-1 [10,19,21]. The gamma secretase protease is involved in many important bodily functions such as immune function, cell development, and homeostasis [8]. 
</strong></p><p><strong>Methods: This project will be conducted by first obtaining a transgenic rodent model of Alzheimer’s disease [7]. The F0 mouse generation will consist of a Cre mouse as the retainer for the Alzheimer’s disease model and a LoxP (Floxed) mouse with the presenilin-1 gene targeted will be bred to create the F1 generation. The F1 generation will have a presenilin-1 knockout. This F1 generation will be compared against a second F1 generation that uses a Cre mouse as the retainer for the Alzheimer’s disease model and a LoxP (Floxed) mouse with the preseniline-1 gene untargeted – leading to a second F1 generation called F1-2 that only shows the detrimental effects of the Alzheimer’s disease model. A ratio of 1:1:1:1 for the model will be used and a total of 40 mice being control female (F1-2 n=10)/control male (F1-2 n=10)/test female (F1 n=10)/test male (F1 n=10). The mice will live in an enriched environment where humidity, light, and food are controlled for – they will be the same in both the F1-2 and F1 models. These rodents will live until adulthood when their brains have had the opportunity to accumulate amyloid beta plaques. The rodent brains will be dissected and then quantified through the ELISA method [18].
</strong></p><p><strong>Expected Results and Alternate Outcomes: An expected outcome is that the rodents in the F1 model (presenilin-1 knockout) will have a decreased amount of aggregated amyloid beta plaques around synapses in the brain whereas in the F1-2 model the rodents will show a greater amount of aggregated amyloid plaques as quantified by the ELISA method [18]. An alternate outcome is that the rodent in the presenilin-1 knockout group may not live until adulthood or we may find that when the presenilin-1 knockout is present abnormal function in the body occurs in areas of immune function, cell development, and homeostasis. We may also find sex differences in these models as they are being measured as well.
</strong></p><p><strong>Pitfalls and Limitations: The Cre-Lox system in the F1 model may kill the rodents before reaching adulthood or after birth and the modification of the genome itself may lead to unforeseen mutations that could lead to detrimental effects in the body of the rodent. The behavior of these mice will not be observed as the amyloid beta plaques are the only thing being quantified other than sex differences in this model. This study also may not be representative of the human model of Alzheimer’s disease.

There is no current drug to block this precursor and in theory it should stop amyloid beta plaque formation. Alzheimer’s disease and other amyloid beta plaque diseases are growing in cases every year [1]. A therapeutic or pharmaceutical intervention needs to be in place as there are none currently that are approved by the FDA [6,14,16].
</strong></p><p><strong>Another future direction would be to investigate the alpha secretase pathway as a potential therapeutic for Alzheimer’s disease [9]. This pathway has not been explored fully for its therapeutic potential. Since the alpha secretase pathway has neurotrophic effects it would be beneficial for another treatment that could coincide with a second treatment further decreasing the effect of amyloid beta plaques [8]. BDNF would most likely be upregulated since there would theoretically be less amyloid beta plaques as they are a suppressor to the CREB and BDNF pathway [8]. Overall, the data obtained from this proposal will further our knowledge and ability to treat Alzheimer’s disease and dementia related neurological diseases.</strong></p><p><strong>
